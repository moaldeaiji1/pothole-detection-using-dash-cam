# pothole-detection-using-dash-cam

# OBJECTIVES
The objective of this project is to use available videos to detect potholes and generate PDF reports that include GPS information. This involves the following key tasks:

1-Pothole Detection: Utilize video data to identify and detect potholes accurately.
2-Report Generation: Create detailed PDF reports that document the detected potholes.
3-GPS Integration: Include GPS information in the reports to provide precise location details of the potholes.

This approach will ensure a comprehensive and informative report on the pothole occurrences, aiding in efficient maintenance and repair.

The model was trained using YOLOv8 with publicly available data.

We trained two models: for weaker PCs, we trained YOLOv8n, and for powerful PCs, we trained YOLOv8l.

YOLOv8n will be faster but less accurate, while YOLOv8l will be slower but more accurate.
